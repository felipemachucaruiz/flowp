You are a senior SaaS architect + full-stack engineer. Build a Management Portal for a multi-tenant POS SaaS (Retail + Restaurant) that includes customer management, support tooling, SaaS billing controls, and electronic billing monitoring (Matias/DIAN integration observability).

The POS is a PWA used in stores. The Management Portal is a separate web app for admins (internal) and tenant admins (customers).

=====================================================
1) PORTAL MODES (TWO PORTALS IN ONE APP)
=====================================================
A) Internal Admin Portal (our staff):
- SuperAdmin: full access
- SupportAgent: tenant support + read billing, cannot access secrets
- BillingOps: subscription plans, invoices, payments, suspensions

B) Tenant Portal (customer admins):
- Owner/Admin: manages business settings, users, locations, registers
- Accountant: electronic billing statuses, reports
- Manager: limited access

Implement strict RBAC and tenant isolation.

=====================================================
2) CORE FEATURES
=====================================================
2.1 Tenant Management (Internal)
- Create tenant (Retail or Restaurant)
- Enable feature flags based on tenant.type
- Suspend/unsuspend tenant (manual + automatic for non-payment)
- View tenant health (last sync, active registers, error rates)

2.2 Onboarding & Configuration (Tenant Portal)
- Company profile, locations, warehouses, registers/devices
- Receipt template config and printer config per register
- Users, roles, permissions
- Import/export CSV for products/customers

2.3 Electronic Billing Monitoring (Matias/DIAN)
- View electronic documents list with filters:
  tenant, date, status, type, sale_id, track_id, CUFE
- Document details page:
  request payload, response payload, status history, error messages
- Actions:
  retry emission, re-poll status, download PDF/XML, mark as reviewed
- Alerts:
  high rejection rate, token failures, numbering conflicts, DIAN downtime indicators

2.4 SaaS Billing (your subscription business)
- Plans (Starter/Pro/Enterprise) with feature limits:
  locations, registers, users, restaurant module, KDS, advanced reports
- Subscription lifecycle:
  trial -> active -> past_due -> suspended -> cancelled
- Payment provider integration placeholder:
  implement a clean BillingProvider interface (Stripe-like)
- Invoices and payment history per tenant
- Automatic suspension rules after N days past_due
- Admin overrides + audit trail

2.5 Support Tooling
- Support tickets (internal + tenant created):
  status, priority, assignee, notes, attachments
- Impersonation ("Support Mode"):
  internal support can view tenant portal as tenant admin (read-only by default; require explicit escalation for write)
- Diagnostics export:
  generate a sanitized bundle: recent errors, register status, electronic document failures (no secrets)
- Activity log:
  who changed what and when

=====================================================
3) DATA MODEL (PostgreSQL + Prisma recommended)
=====================================================
Must include:
- tenants (type, status, feature_flags, created_at)
- tenant_settings (receipt template, timezone, currency)
